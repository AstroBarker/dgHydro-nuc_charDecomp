### Mathematica Notebooks: Eigensystem of Flux Jacobian

`right_eigen.nb` contains the derivation of the right eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian.

`right_inv_eigen.nb` contains the inverse of the matrix of right eigenvectors
and substitutions used to simplify it.

`eigenSysten.mb` contains the all of the eigenvectors and shows the diagonalization.

`ideal/` contains old notebooks for finding the eigensystem for the flux Jacobian of an ideal gas.
