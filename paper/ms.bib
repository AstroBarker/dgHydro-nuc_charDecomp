  abstract	= {Core collapse supernovae occupy a special place in the
		  cosmic hierarchy for their role in disseminating and
		  producing most elements in the Universe heavier than
		  hydrogen and helium, without which life as we know it would
		  not be possible. These catastrophic events mark the end of
		  a massive star's life and the birth of a neutron star or a
		  black hole, and are the most energetic explosions in the
		  Cosmos. Core collapse supernovae result when the iron core
		  of a massive star becomes unstable at the end of the star's
		  evolution, collapses on itself, rebounds at ultra-high
		  densities, and produces a shock wave that will ultimately
		  be responsible for disrupting the star. As infalling core
		  material passes through the shock, it is compressed and
		  heated, and the core nuclei are dissociated (broken up) at
		  the expense of thermal, pressure-producing energy behind
		  the shock, thereby weakening it. In addition to this energy
		  loss, energy is carried away from the shocked region by
		  massless particles know as {\^a}neutrinos{\^a}. The
		  shock stalls, and is later thought to be revived by a
		  {\^a}neutrino heating{\^a} mechanism. At the time
		  the shock stalls, the core consists of an inner
		  {\^a}neutrinosphere{\^a} radiating neutrinos and
		  {\^a}antineutrinos{\^a} of three
		  {\^a}flavors{\^a}: {\^a}electron{\^a},
		  {\^a}muon{\^a}, and {\^a}tau{\^a} neutrinos
		  and their antineutrinos. This inner core will ultimately
		  radiate away its thermal energy, cool, and go on to form a
		  neutron star or a black hole. Revival of the stalled shock
		  above the neutrinosphere is mediated by the absorption of
		  electron neutrinos and antineutrinos emerging from the
		  radiating proto-neutron star. This heating depends
		  sensitively on the neutrino luminosities, spectra, and
		  distribution of neutrino direction cosines in the region
		  behind the shock. In turn, this depends on the neutrino
		  transport through three regions: the
		  {\^a}neutrino-thick{\^a}, diffusion region deep
		  within the core below the neutrinosphere, the
		  {\^a}semitransparent{\^a} region encompassing the
		  neutrinosphere, and the {\^a}neutrino-thin{\^a},
		  streaming region at larger radii. Sufficient accuracy for a
		  definitive simulation of the supernova outcome can be
		  obtained only via a solution of the neutrino Boltzmann
		  transport equations and their coupling to the hydrodynamics
		  equations governing the evolution of the core material. In
		  this article we present a numerical method to solve the
		  neutrino Boltzmann equations coupled to the core
		  hydrodynamics. Spherical symmetry is assumed, but our
		  methods extend to multidimensional Boltzmann transport
		  simulations. (With the assumption of spherical symmetry,
		  radius is the only spatial variable, rendering the
		  simulation, at least as far as the spatial dimensions are
		  concerned, one-dimensional. However, as we will discuss,
		  the Boltzmann equation is a {\^a}phase space{\^a}
		  equation in radius and neutrino direction cosine and
		  energy, and therefore, inherently multidimensional even
		  when spherical symmetry is assumed.) We also present the
		  results of comparisons of {\^a}multigroup flux-limited
		  diffusion{\^a} (approximate) neutrino transport and
		  Boltzmann (exact) neutrino transport in post-core bounce
		  supernova environments, with an eye toward the quantities
		  central to the neutrino-heating, shock-revival mechanism.
		  Multigroup flux-limited diffusion is the most sophisticated
		  transport approximation implemented thus far in core
		  collapse supernova simulations, and will be described in
		  some detail in this article. Our results demonstrate that
		  differences significant to shock revival are obtained with
		  the two transport schemes, supporting the claim that
		  accurate neutrino transport is paramount in simulations of
		  these important cosmic events. We discuss the ramifications
		  our results have for our ongoing simulations of core
		  collapse supernovae with exact Boltzmann neutrino transport.},

  abstract	= {The details of the physical mechanism that drives
		  core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) remain uncertain. While
		  there is an emerging consensus on the qualitative outcome
		  of detailed CCSN mechanism simulations in 2D, only recently
		  have high-fidelity 3D simulations become possible. Here we
		  present the results of an extensive set of 3D CCSN
		  simulations using high-fidelity multidimensional neutrino
		  transport, high-resolution hydrodynamics, and approximate
		  general relativistic gravity. We employ a state-of-the-art
		  20 solar mass progenitor generated using the Modules for
		  Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA; Farmer et al.
		  (2016) Paxton et al. (2011, 2013, 2015, 2018) and the SFHo
		  equation of state of Steiner et al. (2013). While none of
		  our 3D CCSN simulations explode within ~500ms after core
		  bounce, we find that the presence of large scale aspherical
		  motion in the Si and O shells surrounding the collapsing
		  iron core aid shock expansion and bring the models closer
		  to the threshold of explosion. We also find some dependence
		  on resolution and geometry (octant vs. full 4$\pi$). As has
		  been noted in other recent works, we find that the
		  post-shock turbulence plays an important role in
		  determining the overall dynamical evolution of our
		  simulations. We find a strong standing accretion shock
		  instability (SASI) that develops at late times during the
		  shock recession epoch. The SASI aids in transient shock
		  expansion phases, but is not enough to result in shock
		  revival. We also report that for a subset of our
		  simulations, we find conclusive evidence for the LESA first
		  reported in Tamborra et al. (2014), but until now, not
		  confirmed by other simulation codes. Both the progenitor
		  asphericities and the SASI-induced transient shock
		  expansion phases generate transient gravitational waves and

  abstract	= {An important result in core-collapse supernova (CCSN)
		  theory is that spherically symmetric, one-dimensional
		  simulations routinely fail to explode, yet multidimensional
		  simulations often explode. Numerical investigations suggest
		  that turbulence eases the condition for explosion, but how
		  it does it is not fully understood. We develop a turbulence
		  model for neutrino-driven convection, and show that this
		  turbulence model reduces the condition for explosions by
		  about 30%, in concordance with multidimensional
		  simulations. In addition, we identify which turbulent terms
		  enable explosions. Contrary to prior suggestions, turbulent
		  ram pressure is not the dominant factor in reducing the
		  condition for explosion. Instead, there are many
		  contributing factors, with ram pressure being only one of
		  them, but the dominant factor is turbulent dissipation
		  (TD). Primarily, TD provides extra heating, adding
		  significant thermal pressure and reducing the condition for
		  explosion. The source of this TD power is turbulent kinetic
		  energy, which ultimately derives its energy from the higher
		  potential of an unstable convective profile. Investigating
		  a turbulence model in conjunction with an explosion
		  condition enables insight that is difficult to glean from
		  merely analyzing complex multidimensional simulations. An
		  explosion condition presents a clear diagnostic to explain
		  why stars explode, and the turbulence model allows us to
		  explore how turbulence enables explosion. Although we find
		  that TD is a significant contributor to successful
		  supernova explosions, it is important to note that this
		  work is to some extent qualitative. Therefore, we suggest
		  ways to further verify and validate our predictions with
		  multidimensional simulations.},

  abstract	= {Cosmological shock waves play an important role in
		  hierarchical structure formation by dissipating and
		  thermalizing kinetic energy of gas flows, thereby heating
		  the Universe. Furthermore, identifying shocks in
		  hydrodynamical simulations and measuring their Mach number
		  accurately are critical for calculating the production of
		  non-thermal particle components through diffusive shock
		  acceleration. However, shocks are often significantly
		  broadened in numerical simulations, making it challenging
		  to implement an accurate shock finder. We here introduce a
		  refined methodology for detecting shocks in the moving-mesh
		  code AREPO, and show that results for shock statistics can
		  be sensitive to implementation details. We put special
		  emphasis on filtering against spurious shock detections due
		  to tangential discontinuities and contacts. Both of them
		  are omnipresent in cosmological simulations, for example in
		  the form of shear-induced Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities
		  and cold fronts. As an initial application of our new
		  implementation, we analyse shock statistics in
		  non-radiative cosmological simulations of dark matter and
		  baryons. We find that the bulk of energy dissipation at
		  redshift zero occurs in shocks with Mach numbers around
		  M≈ 2.7. Furthermore, almost 40 per cent of the
		  thermalization is contributed by shocks in the warm hot
		  intergalactic medium, whereas ≈60 per cent occurs in
		  clusters, groups, and smaller haloes. Compared to previous
		  studies, these findings revise the characterization of the
		  most important shocks towards higher Mach numbers and lower
		  density structures. Our results also suggest that regions
		  with densities above and below deltab = 100 should be
		  roughly equally important for the energetics of cosmic ray
		  acceleration through large-scale structure shocks.},

		  (3D) simulations with a three-species neutrino

		  direct correlation between the strength of turbulence in
		  the gain layer and the susceptibility to explosion. 2D and
		  3D simulations explode at much lower neutrino heating rates
		  than 1D simulations. This is commonly explained by the fact
		  that nonradial dynamics allows accreting material to stay
		  longer in the gain layer. We show that this explanation is
		  incomplete. Our results indicate that the effective
		  turbulent ram pressure exerted on the shock plays a crucial
		  role by allowing multi-dimensional models to explode at a
		  lower postshock thermal pressure and thus with less
		  neutrino heating than 1D models. We connect the turbulent
		  ram pressure with turbulent energy at large scales and in
		  this way explain why 2D simulations are erroneously
		  exploding more easily than 3D simulations.},

		  construct a quark equation of state, based on the bag model
		  for strange quark matter. The transition between the
		  hadronic and the quark phases is constructed applying Gibbs
		  conditions. The resulting quark-hadron hybrid equations of
		  state are used in core-collapse supernova simulations,
		  based on general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics and
		  three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport in spherical
		  symmetry. The formation of a mixed phase reduces the
		  adiabatic index, which induces the gravitational collapse
		  of the central protoneutron star (PNS). The collapse halts
		  in the pure quark phase, where the adiabatic index
		  increases. A strong accretion shock forms, which propagates
		  toward the PNS surface. Due to the density decrease of
		  several orders of magnitude, the accretion shock turns into
		  a dynamic shock with matter outflow. This moment defines
		  the onset of the explosion in supernova models that allow
		  for a quark-hadron phase transition, where otherwise no
		  explosions could be obtained. The shock propagation across
		  the neutrinospheres releases a burst of neutrinos. This
		  serves as a strong observable identification for the
		  structural reconfiguration of the stellar core. The ejected
		  matter expands on a short timescale and remains
		  neutron-rich. These conditions might be suitable for the
		  production of heavy elements via the r-process. The

  abstract	= {Core-collapse supernovae are among the most fascinating
		  phenomena in astrophysics and provide a formidable
		  challenge for theoretical investigation. They mark the
		  spectacular end of the lives of massive stars and, in an
		  explosive eruption, release as much energy as the sun
		  produces during its whole life. A better understanding of
		  the astrophysical role of supernovae as birth sites of
		  neutron stars, black holes, and heavy chemical elements,
		  and more reliable predictions of the observable signals
		  from stellar death events are tightly linked to the
		  solution of the long-standing puzzle of how collapsing
		  stars achieve explosion. In this article our current
		  knowledge of the processes that contribute to the success
		  of the explosion mechanism is concisely reviewed. After a
		  short overview of the sequence of stages of stellar
		  core-collapse events, the general properties of
		  progenitor-dependent neutrino emission will be briefly
		  described. Applying sophisticated neutrino transport in
		  axisymmetric (2D) simulations with general relativity as
		  well as in simulations with an approximate treatment of
		  relativistic effects, we can find successful
		  neutrino-driven explosions for a growing set of progenitor
		  stars. The first results of three-dimensional (3D) models
		  have been obtained, and magnetohydrodynamic simulations
		  demonstrate that strong initial magnetic fields in the
		  pre-collapse core can foster the onset of neutrino-powered
		  supernova explosions even in nonrotating stars. These
		  results are discussed in the context of the present
		  controversy about the value of 2D simulations for exploring
		  the supernova mechanism in realistic 3D environments, and
		  they are interpreted against the background of the current
		  disagreement on the question of whether the standing
		  accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven
		  convection is the crucial agency that supports the onset of
		  the explosion.},

  abstract	= {Simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) result in
		  successful explosions once the neutrino luminosity exceeds
		  a critical curve, and recent simulations indicate that
		  turbulence further enables explosion by reducing this
		  critical neutrino luminosity. We propose a theoretical
		  framework to derive this result and take the first steps by
		  deriving the governing mean-field equations. Using Reynolds
		  decomposition, we decompose flow variables into background
		  and turbulent flows and derive self-consistent averaged
		  equations for their evolution. As basic requirements for
		  the CCSN problem, these equations naturally incorporate
		  steady-state accretion, neutrino heating and cooling,
		  non-zero entropy gradients, and turbulence terms associated
		  with buoyant driving, redistribution, and dissipation.
		  Furthermore, analysis of two-dimensional (2D) CCSN
		  simulations validate these Reynolds-averaged equations, and
		  we show that the physics of turbulence entirely accounts
		  for the differences between 1D and 2D CCSN simulations. As
		  a prelude to deriving the reduction in the critical
		  luminosity, we identify the turbulent terms that most
		  influence the conditions for explosion. Generically,
		  turbulence equations require closure models, but these
		  closure models depend upon the macroscopic properties of
		  the flow. To derive a closure model that is appropriate for
		  CCSNe, we cull the literature for relevant closure models
		  and compare each with 2D simulations. These models employ
		  local closure approximations and fail to reproduce the
		  global properties of neutrino-driven turbulence. Motivated
		  by the generic failure of these local models, we propose an
		  original model for turbulence which incorporates global
		  properties of the flow. This global model accurately
		  reproduces the turbulence profiles and evolution of 2D CCSN
		  simulations.},

  abstract	= {Many of the currently available equations of state for
		  core-collapse supernova simulations give large neutron star
		  radii and do not provide large enough neutron star masses,
		  both of which are inconsistent with some recent neutron
		  star observations. In addition, one of the critical
		  uncertainties in the nucleon-nucleon interaction, the
		  nuclear symmetry energy, is not fully explored by the
		  currently available equations of state. In this article, we
		  construct two new equations of state which match recent
		  neutron star observations and provide more flexibility in
		  studying the dependence on nuclear matter properties. The
		  equations of state are also provided in tabular form,
		  covering a wide range in density, temperature, and
		  asymmetry, suitable for astrophysical simulations. These
		  new equations of state are implemented into our spherically
		  symmetric core-collapse supernova model, which is based on
		  general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics with
		  three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport. The results are
		  compared with commonly used equations of state in supernova
		  simulations of 11.2 and 40 M &sun; progenitors. We consider
		  only equations of state which are fitted to nuclear binding
		  energies and other experimental and observational
		  constraints. We find that central densities at bounce are
		  weakly correlated with L and that there is a moderate
		  influence of the symmetry energy on the evolution of the
		  electron fraction. The new models also obey the previously
		  observed correlation between the time to black hole
		  formation and the maximum mass of an s = 4 neutron star.},

@Article{	  couch:2013,
  abstract	= {Self-gravity computation by multipole expansion is a
		  common approach in problems such as core-collapse and Type
		  Ia supernovae, where single large condensations of mass
		  must be treated. The standard formulation of multipole
		  self-gravity in arbitrary coordinate systems suffers from
		  two significant sources of error, which we correct in the
		  formulation presented in this article. The first source of
		  error is due to the numerical approximation that
		  effectively places grid cell mass at the central point of
		  the cell, then computes the gravitational potential at that
		  point, resulting in a convergence failure of the multipole
		  expansion. We describe a new scheme that avoids this
		  problem by computing gravitational potential at cell faces.
		  The second source of error is due to sub-optimal choice of
		  location for the expansion center, which results in angular
		  power at high multipole l values in the gravitational
		  field, requiring a high---and expensive---value of
		  multipole cutoff l max. By introducing a global measure of
		  angular power in the gravitational field, we show that the
		  optimal coordinate for the expansion is the
		  square-density-weighted mean location. We subject our new
		  multipole self-gravity algorithm, implemented in the FLASH
		  simulation framework, to two rigorous test problems:
		  MacLaurin spheroids for which exact analytic solutions are
		  known, and core-collapse supernovae. We show that key
		  observables of the core-collapse simulations, particularly
		  shock expansion, proto-neutron star motion, and momentum
		  conservation, are extremely sensitive to the accuracy of
		  the multipole gravity, and the accuracy of their
		  computation is greatly improved by our reformulated
		  solver.},

  abstract	= {Multi-dimensional instabilities have become an important
		  ingredient in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) theory.
		  Therefore, it is necessary to understand the driving
		  mechanism of the dominant instability. We compare our
		  parameterized three-dimensional CCSN simulations with other
		  buoyancy-driven simulations and propose scaling relations
		  for neutrino-driven convection. Through these comparisons,
		  we infer that buoyancy-driven convection dominates
		  post-shock turbulence in our simulations. In support of
		  this inference, we present four major results. First, the
		  convective fluxes and kinetic energies in the
		  neutrino-heated region are consistent with expectations of
		  buoyancy-driven convection. Second, the convective flux is
		  positive where buoyancy actively drives convection, and the
		  radial and tangential components of the kinetic energy are
		  in rough equipartition (i.e., Kr ~ K theta + K phi). Both
		  results are natural consequences of buoyancy-driven
		  convection, and are commonly observed in simulations of
		  convection. Third, buoyant driving is balanced by turbulent
		  dissipation. Fourth, the convective luminosity and
		  turbulent dissipation scale with the driving neutrino
		  power. In all, these four results suggest that in

		  are consistent with neutrino-driven convection.},

  abstract	= {We present the first two-dimensional general relativistic
		  (GR) simulations of stellar core collapse and explosion
		  with the COCONUT hydrodynamics code in combination with the
		  VERTEX solver for energy-dependent, three-flavor neutrino
		  transport, using the extended conformal flatness condition
		  for approximating the space-time metric and a
		  ray-by-ray-plus ansatz to tackle the multi-dimensionality
		  of the transport. For both of the investigated 11.2 and 15
		  M &sun; progenitors we obtain successful, though seemingly
		  marginal, neutrino-driven supernova explosions. This
		  outcome and the time evolution of the models basically
		  agree with results previously obtained with the PROMETHEUS
		  hydro solver including an approximative treatment of
		  relativistic effects by a modified Newtonian potential.
		  However, GR models exhibit subtle differences in the
		  neutrinospheric conditions compared with Newtonian and
		  pseudo-Newtonian simulations. These differences lead to
		  significantly higher luminosities and mean energies of the
		  radiated electron neutrinos and antineutrinos and therefore
		  to larger energy-deposition rates and heating efficiencies
		  in the gain layer with favorable consequences for strong
		  nonradial mass motions and ultimately for an explosion.
		  Moreover, energy transfer to the stellar medium around the
		  neutrinospheres through nucleon recoil in scattering
		  reactions of heavy-lepton neutrinos also enhances the
		  mentioned effects. Together with previous pseudo-Newtonian
		  models, the presented relativistic calculations suggest
		  that the treatment of gravity and energy-exchanging
		  neutrino interactions can make differences of even 50%-100%
		  in some quantities and is likely to contribute to a finally
		  successful explosion mechanism on no minor level than
		  hydrodynamical differences between different dimensions.},

		  high-energy and nuclear astrophysics and the numerical arts
		  to present theorists with one of the most important, yet
		  frustrating, astronomical questions: ``What is the
		  mechanism of core-collapse supernova explosions?'' A review
		  of all the physics and the 50-year history involved would
		  soon bury the reader in minutiae that could easily obscure
		  the essential elements of the phenomenon, as we understand
		  it today. Moreover, much remains to be discovered and
		  explained, and a complicated review of an unresolved
		  subject in flux could grow stale fast. Therefore, this
		  paper describes various important facts and perspectives
		  that may have escaped the attention of those interested in
		  this puzzle. Furthermore, an attempt to describe the modern
		  theory's physical underpinnings and a brief summary of the
		  current state of play are given. In the process, a few
		  myths that have crept into modern discourse are identified.
		  However, there is much more to do and humility in the face
		  of this age-old challenge is clearly the most prudent
		  stance as its eventual resolution is sought.},

  abstract	= {Supernovae of Type II occur at the end of the evolution of
		  massive stars. The phenomenon begins when the iron core of
		  the star exceeds a Chandrasekhar mass. The collapse of that
		  core under gravity is well understood and takes a fraction
		  of a second. To understand the phenomenon, a detailed
		  knowledge of the equation of state at the relevant
		  densities and temperatures is required. After collapse, the
		  shock wave moves outward, but probably does not succeed in
		  expelling the mass of the star. The most likely mechanism
		  to do so is the absorption of neutrinos from the core by
		  the material at medium distances. Observations and theory
		  connected with SN 1987A are discussed, as are the
		  conditions just before collapse and the emission of
		  neutrinos by the collapsed core.},

  abstract	= {We present results from high-resolution semiglobal
		  simulations of neutrino-driven convection in core-collapse
		  supernovae. We employ an idealized setup with parameterized
		  neutrino heating/cooling and nuclear dissociation at the
		  shock front. We study the internal dynamics of
		  neutrino-driven convection and its role in redistributing
		  energy and momentum through the gain region. We find that
		  even if buoyant plumes are able to locally transfer heat up
		  to the shock, convection is not able to create a net
		  positive energy flux and overcome the downward transport of
		  energy from the accretion flow. Turbulent convection does,
		  however, provide a significant effective pressure support
		  to the accretion flow as it favors the accumulation of
		  energy, mass, and momentum in the gain region. We derive an
		  approximate equation that is able to explain and predict
		  the shock evolution in terms of integrals of quantities
		  such as the turbulent pressure in the gain region or the
		  effects of nonradial motion of the fluid. We use this
		  relation as a way to quantify the role of turbulence in the
		  dynamics of the accretion shock. Finally, we investigate
		  the effects of grid resolution, which we change by a factor
		  of 20 between the lowest and highest resolution. Our
		  results show that the shallow slopes of the turbulent
		  kinetic energy spectra reported in previous studies are a
		  numerical artifact. Kolmogorov scaling is progressively
		  recovered as the resolution is increased.},

  abstract	= {We present a new approach to understand the landscape of
		  supernova explosion energies, ejected nickel masses, and
		  neutron star birth masses. In contrast to other recent
		  parametric approaches, our model predicts the properties of
		  neutrino-driven explosions based on the pre-collapse
		  stellar structure without the need for hydrodynamic
		  simulations. The model is based on physically motivated
		  scaling laws and simple differential equations describing
		  the shock propagation, the contraction of the neutron star,
		  the neutrino emission, the heating conditions, and the
		  explosion energetics. Using model parameters compatible
		  with multi-D simulations and a fine grid of thousands of
		  supernova progenitors, we obtain a variegated landscape of
		  neutron star and black hole formation similar to other
		  parametrized approaches and find good agreement with
		  semi-empirical measures for the `explodability' of massive
		  stars. Our predicted explosion properties largely conform
		  to observed correlations between the nickel mass and
		  explosion energy. Accounting for the coexistence of
		  outflows and downflows during the explosion phase, we
		  naturally obtain a positive correlation between explosion
		  energy and ejecta mass. These correlations are relatively
		  robust against parameter variations, but our results
		  suggest that there is considerable leeway in parametric
		  models to widen or narrow the mass ranges for black hole
		  and neutron star formation and to scale explosion energies
		  up or down. Our model is currently limited to an
		  all-or-nothing treatment of fallback and there remain some
		  minor discrepancies between model predictions and

  abstract	= {Nonspherical mass motions are a generic feature of
		  core-collapse supernovae, and hydrodynamic instabilities
		  play a crucial role in the explosion mechanism. The first

		  with self-consistent, first-principles simulations in three

		  to be less prone to explosion than the corresponding
		  axisymmetric two-dimensional (2D) ones. The reason is that

		  spatial scales, the inverse of the 2D case, thus
		  disfavoring the growth of buoyant plumes on the largest
		  scales. Unless the inertia to explode simply reflects a

		  important component of robust and sufficiently energetic
		  neutrino-powered explosions may still be missing. Such a
		  deficit could be associated with progenitor properties such
		  as rotation, magnetic fields, or precollapse perturbations,
		  or with microphysics that could cause enhancement of
		  neutrino heating behind the shock. 3D simulations have also
		  revealed new phenomena that are not present in 2D ones,
		  such as spiral modes of the standing accretion shock

		  core-collapse and supernova explosions over the past 15
		  years are reviewed, concentrating on the evolution of
		  hydrodynamical simulations, the description of weak
		  interactions and nuclear equation of state effects, and new
		  insights into the nucleosynthesis occurring in the early
		  phases of the explosion, in particular the neutrino-p
		  process. The latter is enabled by the proton-richness of
		  the early ejecta, which was discovered because significant
		  progress has been made in the treatment of neutrino
		  transport and weak interactions. This progress has led to a
		  new generation of sophisticated Newtonian and relativistic
		  hydrodynamics simulations in spherical symmetry. Based on
		  these, it is now clear that the prompt bounce-shock
		  mechanism is not the driver of supernova explosions, and
		  that the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism can produce
		  explosions without the aid of multi-dimensional processes
		  only if the progenitor star has an ONeMg core inside a very
		  dilute He-core, i.e., has a mass in the 8 10M range.
		  Hydrodynamic instabilities of various kinds have indeed
		  been recognized to occur in the supernova core and to be of
		  potential importance for the explosion. Neutrino-driven
		  explosions, however, have been seen in two-dimensional

		  only when the star has a small iron core and low density in
		  the surrounding shells as being found in stars near 10 11M.
		  The explosion mechanism of more massive progenitors is
		  still a puzzle. It might involve effects of
		  three-dimensional hydrodynamics or might point to the
		  relevance of rapid rotation and magnetohydrodynamics, or to
		  still incompletely explored properties of neutrinos and the

  abstract	= {In the present method for the construction of solutions to
		  the gas dynamics Riemann problem by means of a general
		  convex equation of state, the numerical fluxes in
		  conservative finite difference schemes are calculated on
		  the basis of approximate procedures that involve a local
		  parameterization of the equation of state. Difference
		  schemes are thereby obtained which are accurate and nearly
		  as fast as analogous ones for polytropic gases. Attention
		  is given to numerical results in one- and two-space
		  variables.},
